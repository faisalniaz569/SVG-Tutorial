SVG Code explanation:

=> Start with the <svg> root element, define the width and height, and proper namespace
=> The <rect> element is used to draw a rectangle
=> The width and height of the rectangle is set to 100% of the width/height of the <svg> element
=> Set the fill color of the rectangle to green
=> The <circle> element is used to draw a circle
=> The cx and cy attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle
=> The r attribute defines the radius of the circle
=> We set the fill color of the circle to yellow
=> The <text> element is used to draw a text
=> The x and y attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the text
=> The font-size attribute defines the font size of the text
=> The text-anchor attribute defines where we want the midpoint (of the text) to be
=> The fill attribute defines the color of the text
=> Write "SVG" as the text to show
